This is the "Etch-A-Sketch" project from The Odin Project.

To use this sketching program, you may go to this [link](https://rheechashaipu.github.io/TOP-Grid-Project/)

Or you can download the repo and simply open the index.html file.

Clicking the 'reset' button will allow you to generate a new grid. It'll ask you for an integer
and then construct a grid with n*n dimensions. For instance, giving an integer value of 3 will result in a 3x3 grid.

The "Opacity" button will also request a grid size. Mousing over grids here will reduce the
opacity of grids by 0.1.
